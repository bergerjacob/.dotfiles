    ### Display ###
    # The monitor on which to display notifications. 0 is the first, 1 the second, etc.
    # You can also use "mouse" to display notifications on the monitor with the mouse.
    # Replace "DP-0" with your monitor's name if you know it, otherwise 0 should work.
    monitor = "DP-0"

    # The geometry of the notification window.
    # format: "{width}x{height}[+/-{x}[+/-{y}]]"
    # width:  width of the notification
    # height: height of the notification
    # x/y:    offset from the origin
    # Negative values are offsets from the right/bottom edge.
    geometry = "350x5-30+50"

    # Where to place notifications on the screen.

    ### Text & Font ###

    # %a  appname
    # %s  summary
    # %b  body
    # %I  icon path
    # %p  progress value

    ### Appearance ###
    # The width of the frame around the notification window.

    # Separator height. A value of 0 means no separator.

    # A subtle transparency. Requires a compositor (like picom).
    # This sets the window opacity. 0 is fully transparent, 100 is fully opaque.
    opacity = 95
    
    ### Behavior ###
